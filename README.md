# block_entity_data

A Rust crate for handling block entity data in Minecraft.  
This crate is mainly focused on *reading* block entity data  
and deserialize it into Rust data structures.  

But it can also serialize back into NBT format but there may be issues and or bloated NBT data.  

## TODO

- [ ] Add test inside every block entity .rs file to test all their data
- [ ] Fix broken components
- [ ] Add all block entity & component default values if specified on wiki.
- [ ] Add all components
- [ ] Add tests for all components
